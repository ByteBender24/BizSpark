1. MSME Definition and Classification
Background:

Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) form the backbone of the Indian economy, contributing significantly to employment generation, exports, and industrial output. The Government of India revised the MSME definition in 2020 to enable easier classification and better support.

Current Definition (Effective July 1, 2020):

MSMEs are classified based on annual turnover and investment in plant and machinery or equipment:

Enterprise Type	Investment Limit (₹)	Annual Turnover Limit (₹)
Micro	≤ ₹1 crore	≤ ₹5 crore
Small	≤ ₹10 crore	≤ ₹50 crore
Medium	≤ ₹50 crore	≤ ₹250 crore

Notes:

Enterprises are categorized based on either investment or turnover, whichever is lower.

The updated definition is applicable to both manufacturing and service sectors.
